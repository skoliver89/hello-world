Learning GitHub

Greetings!

This repository is of the sole purpose for me to learn how to utilize GitHub. It was brought to my attention that GitHub, or
some other built on Git system, will be used in my future Senior Project classes. Also, I am told that GitHub experience is
valuable during the hiring process and beyound.

Cheers
And
All Hail Octocat!
